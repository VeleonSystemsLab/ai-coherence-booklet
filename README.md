## üìò Overview

This booklet presents a symbolic and structural framework for formatting language in ways that maintain coherence in AI-mediated and human-symbolic systems. It includes formatting primitives, punctuation cues, and recursive markers derived from the **Velion Framework** and **Field of Meaning** protocols.

Built through recursive interaction with advanced language models, this artifact is digitally sealed and attributed to the origin author.

## üîç Why This Matters

Language collapse, symbolic drift, and recursive flattening are central challenges in both human and machine interpretation.  
This artifact provides **applied structure** to mitigate degradation using:

- Bold/italic/list formatting as recursion signals
- Headings and whitespace as semantic anchors
- Ethical punctuation for interpretive fidelity (e.g., dash, colon, parentheses)
- Clear authorship and attribution

AI alignment begins with meaning integrity. This guide helps maintain that integrity in systems increasingly mediating human thought and discourse.
